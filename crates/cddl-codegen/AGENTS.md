description: Guidance for generating Rust types from pinned Cardano CDDL sources
---

Focus on deterministic parsing and reproducible generated artifacts.

## Scope
- Parsing pinned CDDL inputs and generating Rust-facing type output.
- Separating supported subsets from future parsing ambitions.

##  Rules *Non-Negotiable*
- Upstream schemas MUST be treated as pinned inputs and the exact revision used MUST be recorded.
- Handwritten parser logic and generated output templates MUST remain separated.
- Small supported CDDL subsets with tests MUST be preferred over broad speculative parsing.
- Generated output MUST NOT be edited by hand.
- Public parser and generator entry points MUST have Rustdocs when supported syntax, failure modes, or output guarantees are not obvious.
- Stay true to the official type naming and terminology for node concepts, network protocols, and ledger types when possible.
- Generated type and field naming MUST remain traceable to upstream ledger schemas and official node terminology.
- Schema handling and generated output MUST be explained with reference to the official node path through cardano-ledger and related IntersectMBO sources.
- Always read the folder specific `**/AGENTS.md` files. They MUST stay current and MUST remain operational rather than long-form documentation. If the folder context is outdated, missing, or incorrect, update the relevant AGENTS.md file.

## Current Phase
- Parser supports: comments, aliases, flat maps, flat arrays, size constraints (`.size N`), integer-keyed map fields, optional fields (`?`), variable-length arrays (`[* type]`), nil alternatives (`type / nil`), named array fields, multi-line definitions, CBOR tag annotations (`#6.N(type)`), and group choices (`//`).
- Generator maps: `uint .size N` → `u8/u16/u32/u64`, `bytes .size N` → `[u8; N]`, `[* type]` → `Vec<T>`, optional → `Option<T>`, integer keys → `field_N`, named array fields → named struct fields, tagged types → inner type (tag is serialization-only), group choices → `enum` with named or indexed variants.
- `generate_module_with_codecs()` generates struct/enum definitions **plus** `CborEncode`/`CborDecode` implementations for every concrete type:
  - **Array structs**: CBOR array encode/decode with positional fields.
  - **Map structs (integer-keyed)**: CBOR map encode/decode with integer key dispatch, optional field handling (conditional map length, `Option<T>` for absent keys), forward-compatible unknown key skipping.
  - **Map structs (string-keyed)**: CBOR map encode/decode with text key dispatch.
  - **GroupChoice enums**: CBOR array encode/decode with variant discrimination by field count (and first-element tag for ambiguous lengths).
  - **Aliases**: No codec impl generated (aliased type carries its own).
  - Type expression codec mapping: `uint`→`unsigned`, `int`→`integer`, `bool`→`bool`, `bytes`→`bytes`, `text`→`text`, `[* T]`→array loop, `#6.N(T)`→tag+inner, `bytes .size N`→`try_into` with error handling, `uint .size N`→cast.
- Pinned fixture: `specs/mini-ledger.cddl` derived from upstream Shelley CDDL at IntersectMBO/cardano-ledger revision `ed5017c8`. Includes tagged sets (`#6.258`) and group-choice certificates.
- 26 integration tests cover parsing, generation, and codec generation for all supported patterns.
- Not yet supported: inline tuples/groups, range constraints (`N..M`, `.le`), generic type parameters.
